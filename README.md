# Patterns for "infrastructure-as-code"

Slide deck of presentation "**Patterns for "infrastructure-as-code"**" given at **Codemotion** (Berlin), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> One of the ways to describe software architecture is to express its configuration in executable and repeatable form â€“ infrastructure as code. Tools that are often used for this purpose (e.g., Puppet, Ansible, Chef) are not utilized to their full potential. Provided abstractions, extension points, existing modules are ignored by turning provisioning software into a fancy file copying utility. Software configuration has a variety of patterns and abstractions to better communicate the intent of the architecture described in the form of infrastructure as code.
